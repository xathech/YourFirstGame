# YourFirstGame
Godot Engine 3.2.3 "Your first game" implementation.

This is my implementation of the ["Your first game"](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.3/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html) tutorial provided by Godot on the [**version 3.2.3**](https://downloads.tuxfamily.org/godotengine/3.2.3/).

The most notable diference would be a working lives system, where the player sprite will fade-out when hit (contrary to the direct game-over).

I tried to provide as many comments to explain how each system works (unless it's  self-explanatory by the function or variable names).
